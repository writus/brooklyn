			<p>One of the biggest reasons I depart from my minimalist philosophy is reading.</p>
            <p>Specifically, reading about what others are doing.</p>
            <p>I read a blog post, or a magazine article, about someone doing something interesting: traveling, using a new productivity system, doing a new kind of workout, brewing artisinal coffee, making bread. And then I want to do that too.</p>
            <p>And I think we all do this. We all read inspirational things, or hear about them from a friend, and fantasize about ourselves doing the same thing.</p>
            <p>This is often a good thing β€” inspiration is good, right? Learning from others is definitely good. But this inspiration can often cause me to forget about what Iβ€™ve learned, and soon Iβ€™m heading down a new path, buying a lot of things to support my new pursuit β€¦ only to abandon this pursuit when Iβ€™ve read something else.</p>
            <p>This has happened to me dozens of times. I want to learn Spanish, programming, breadmaking, pizzamaking, teamaking, hiking, Crossfit, ultrarunning, drawing, fiction writing, guitar, history, films, great novels, and more.</p>
            <p>Individually, each of these is wonderful. But when I get obsessed with the next new thing to learn about, the other things suffer. I canβ€™t learn about them all at once. Such distraction pulls away my focus, keeps me from doing well at any one thing.</p>
            <p>Whatβ€™s the antidote? Focus. Sticking to something long enough to really learn it. Remembering your priorities. Not getting distracted by every new thing you read.</p>
            <p>The answer isnβ€™t to stop reading, but to be more mindful of your impulses when you do read.</p>
